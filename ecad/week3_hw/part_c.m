% Advantages of using two-stage output filter rather than single-stage

% Single-stage's attenuation increases at -40dB/decade above resonance
% Two-stage's attenuation increases at -80dB/decade above resonance

% ^ This means that the two-stage filter is twice as effective at attenuating high frequencies.

% In order for the single-stage to get the same results as two-stage, it needs components that are about 10-30 times larger in value,
% meaning that it will be heavier and more expensive to make.
